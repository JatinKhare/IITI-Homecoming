# IITI-Homecoming
My Intern at Indian Institute of Technology, Indore in the summer break of 2019 helped me uncover the dark truths about Fourier Transform.
Yes. It's not good for Non-Stationary signal. Seriously. It isn't.

And that is why we worked on various algorithms to make things right. 

Introducing to:

1. Short-time-fourier-transform(STFT)
2. Wavelet Transform (WT)
3. Hilbert Haung Transform (EMD and IMFs) (HHT)
4. Empirical Wavelet Transform(EWT)
5. Fourier-Bessel series expansion based EWT
